# Social Media Pulse

Presentation slides+ for 2014-02-05 [AnalyzeBoulder Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Analyze-Boulder/events/156806792/). Meant to be a brief 10-minute introduction to social data and a model we've worked on to model sudden events as observed by users of social media platforms.

In the `data/` directory is an IPython notebook with some code for generating the figures. With the proper packages installed, you can download and play with that on your machine or you can also view it statically on [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrmontag/AnalyzeBoulder-SocialPulse/blob/master/data/AB_social-pulse.ipynb) without needing to experience the fun of a `numpy` install. 

Enjoy.
