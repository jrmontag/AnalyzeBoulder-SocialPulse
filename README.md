# Social Media Pulse

[Presentation slides](http://jrmontag.github.io/AnalyzeBoulder-SocialPulse)+ for the 2014-02-05 [AnalyzeBoulder Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Analyze-Boulder/events/156806792/). [ Shareable [bit.ly link](http://bit.ly/AB-Pulse) ]

Meant to be a ~10-minute introduction to social data and a model on which we're working that describes the result of many users sharing unexpected events on social media platforms.

In the `data/` directory there is an IPython notebook that generates the figures used in the slides. With the proper packages installed (`numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels`), you can fork/clone this repo and explore on your own machine. If you don't want to experience the fun of an initial `numpy` install, you can also [view it statically on nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrmontag/AnalyzeBoulder-SocialPulse/blob/master/data/AB_social-pulse.ipynb).

Enjoy.
