# The Social Activity Pulse

### sketch
2013-02-05, 10 mins, general public, min('how'), max('what'|'why') 

### take-aways
1. classes of activity & why helpful 

2. social media pulse (many simultaneous observers) & sigmoid (network spread) models (maybe) 

3. what we can do with that information

# outline *(WIP)*

- context (for social data)

    - ~a decade into the [social data revolution](http://blogs.hbr.org/2009/05/the-social-data-revolution/) = mucho data

    - new channel for making measurements of social and humanitarian issues (unemployment, illness, politics), cheaper and more real-time than e.g. government census 

    - how much data? (+ grapherator twitter data) -- everything from the Golden Globe awards show to the current Ukrainian riots is in that data 


- need a way to describe and classify narrow / focussed events in large data stream, eg: 
            
    - compare evolution of stories with different scales, compare user behavior across platforms, identify emerging stories & source type


## expected v. unexpected

- examples 

    - expected: winter storm (Janus: ~2014-01-21) 

    - unexpected: news story (google + nest ~ 2014-01-13?) 

- lines through each 

## *social media pulse* 

- (only slide with formulas!)

- poisson counting process where probability of an observer posting/sharing is exponentially decaying in time (+formula) 
- many observers ==> sum of independent random variables is the convolution of these ==> gamma

- example + parameters 

- example with data 


## event parameters 

- story half-life (+example?)

- total story volume

- time to peak

    
## other models?

- network spread

- hybrid 



# assorted other things 

- cross-social-platform comparison of models

- (non-parametric) trend detection
